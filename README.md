# Telegram Clone

A ReactJS-based clone of the Telegram messaging application. This project aims to replicate the core functionalities of Telegram, including a responsive design, a chat list, and a message view. Users can toggle between light and dark modes, and navigate through various options like profile, contacts, and settings.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes. Displays three columns (navbar, chat list, and messages area) on screens wider than 768px, and a single column layout on smaller screens.
- **Chat List**: Displays a list of available chats. Users can select a chat to view messages.
- **Message View**: Shows messages within the selected chat. The message view is scrollable.
- **Sticky Elements**: Navbar, chat header, and chat input are fixed, ensuring that only the messages area is scrollable.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark modes with a smooth transition.
- **User Options**: Includes options such as My Profile, New Group, Contacts, Calls, and Settings.
